# Trial_Run
First trial run, first repository

I would like to code a conversational chat bot for a request that my father has. I would like it to operate from a Raspberry Pi 4, with a speaker and microphone input. His preference is to make the voice sound like Bob the skull from The Dresden Files. I would like the knowledge base and responses to run through Open AI and it could use my API key if necessary. What questions do you have for me to get started on this project?

You replied: Here are some clarifying questions that will help you design the Raspberry Pi–based chatbot and ensure it works as desired:

   1. Hardware setup

        Do you already have a specific microphone and speaker model in mind for the Raspberry Pi 4, or will you need suggestions?

        Will the Raspberry Pi have a stable internet connection, or do you want it to work offline for some functionality?

   2. Software environment

        Have you already installed an operating system on the Raspberry Pi (e.g., Raspberry Pi OS)?

        Do you prefer to develop in a particular programming language (Python is common for Pi projects)?

        Are you comfortable with installing additional libraries (e.g., pyaudio, speech_recognition, openai)?

   3. OpenAI integration

        Do you already have an OpenAI API key, and are you familiar with the API’s rate limits and usage costs?

        How large or specialized is your knowledge base? Is it primarily open-domain conversation, or do you have particular topics you’d like the bot to handle (e.g., personal stories, references from “The Dresden Files”)?

   4. Voice style

        For making the voice sound like Bob the skull, are you interested in using a text-to-speech service that can mimic that voice, or would you like to pre-record certain phrases in a similar voice style?

        Do you need the voice synthesis to run locally on the Pi, or is it okay if it uses a cloud-based API?

   5. Conversation flow and features

        How interactive or persistent do you want the conversation to be? (e.g., should it remember previous interactions, handle follow-up questions, or keep a conversation history?)

        Are you planning any specific commands or wake words to activate the bot, or should it always listen?

   6. Accessibility and security

        Will this bot be used only by your father, or will it be shared with others?

        If using your OpenAI API key, do you plan to store it securely on the Raspberry Pi (e.g., in an environment variable or separate configuration file)?

   7. Testing and deployment

        Do you want the chatbot code version-controlled (e.g., stored in a Git repository) for easier updates?

        How will you test the hardware and microphone/speaker setup? Are you comfortable with troubleshooting audio configuration on the Pi?

Then I answered:

1. I do not have a specific microphone or speaker in mind. The end goal is to have it all fit inside of a plastic skull, with AC power cord coming out. The Pi will have stable internet connection.
2. I have Raspberry Pi OS, no preference on language. I have used Java Script, HTML, and VBA primarily. I understand Python is common and may be optimal and have no objection to that. I am comfortable installing additional libraries. 
3. I have an OpenAI API key. I don't recall the usage limits, but I don't imagine I will approach and issue. We can test token usage once we're up and running. For knowledge base my thought was similar to how I use my OpenAI app on my phone, conversationally, and ask it to check news headlines and stock prices. If it is recommended to host a knowledge base there should be quite a bit of room on the mostly empty Pi.
4. I would want a text to speech service that can mimic that voice. Nothing prerecorded. It would be easy enough to feed voice clips to a service that would then mimic it, assuming nothing exists now. I would prefer the voice synthesis run locally if that seems feasible. I feel this would have faster more organic response times. If that doesn't work, cloud-based is acceptable. 
5. I would prefer it remembers previous interactions and keep a conversation history, but separate from my personal conversation history. If needed I could start him a new OpenAI account. Let's have it always on, and I can put a physical cut off switch in the mic line.
6. The bot will be used only by my father. Plan to store the OpenAI API key on the Pi.
7. I do want the chatbot code to be version-controlled in my Git repository. I am comfortable troubleshooting audio configuration on the pi.
